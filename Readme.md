# Currency calculator - React

I invite you to familiarize yourself with the application...

Demo here:

The project consists in transferring the application I created earlier to the React environment,
at the same time, the visual layer has been improved,and the application was adapted to screens below 767px.

An older version can be seen here:

Of course, all the scripting has changed. Now everything is based on arrays and objects, which makes application management much easier and clearer.
